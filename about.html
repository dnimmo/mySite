    <p>I'm a web developer from Newcastle Upon Tyne, England, and I believe that the web should be taken seriously. I believe that we should be planning for tomorrow, rather than hacking things together for today. And I believe in choosing technologies that will help you, not just sticking to what you know.</p>
    <p>I like to play with new web technologies.</p>
    <p>I like to see things being done right.</p>
