	 	<h2>My name's David.</h2>   
	    <p>I'm a web developer from Newcastle Upon Tyne, England, and I love the internet, which is why I'm doing my bit to help make it a better place. I believe that we should be planning for tomorrow, rather than hacking things together for today. I believe that anything is possible, and I believe doing things is more important than being seen to be doing things.</p>
	    <p>I'm happily employed by a major airline as part of their web dev team, but spend a lot of my own time playing with web technologies that I don't get to have fun with during the day.</p>
	    <p>I currently live in Newcastle with my wife, my dog, and my three cats.</p>
